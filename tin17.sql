I hopped out and dodged buzzing motorbikes and exhaust-belching cars, trying to get from curb to curb.</p>\n<p>Then I spotted it: Banh Mi Pho Hue (118 Phố Huế; 84-4-3822-5009), the no-frills sandwich shop named for the Hanoi street on which it sits. Nearly everyone I&rsquo;d asked had said Banh Mi Pho Hue served the tastiest banh mi in Hanoi. But the family that&rsquo;s run the shop since 1974 has a reputation for closing it whenever the cooks run out of ingredients. So when I arrived at 7pm on a Saturday and found it still open, I was delighted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<dl class="inline-image">\n<dt><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwtravel/464_261/images/live/p0/27/x3/p027x3tc.jpg" alt="Hanoi, Vietnam" width="464" height="261" /></dt>\n<dd>Life in Hanoi. (Hoang Dinh Nam/Getty)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Translated simply as &ldquo;wheat,&rdquo; the banh mi is a delicious and ever-varying combination of deli-style pork, pate and veggies (think carrots, cilantro, cucumber, etc), stuffed into a soft and crunchy French baguette. Regional variations in Vietnam involve adding headcheese, pork sausage and various other vegetables.</p>\n<p>In an age of hipster food mashups &ndash; Korean tacos, anyone? &ndash; the banh mi is the product of a true cultural and culinary blend. No food trucks, Instagram photos or tweets led to its creation. The sandwich began with colonialism &ndash; specifically, the establishment of French Indochina in 1887 &ndash; when the occupying French simply slathered butter and pate inside a baguette. Then when the Vietnamese sent the French packing in 1954, they put their own spin on the sandwich, adding slices of pork, herbs and pickled vegetables, and creating the banh mi as we know it.</p>\n<p>The rest of the world didn&rsquo;t learn about this spectacular sandwich until after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. As many southern Vietnamese emigrated to the United States, Europe and Australia, they brought recipes, including one for their iconic sandwich. As a result, if you&rsquo;re eating a banh mi outside of Vietnam, you&rsquo;re probably enjoying a southern-style snack: the baguettes are generally bigger and they&rsquo;re crammed with more veggies and herbs, such as cilantro, carrots and hot peppers.</p>\n<p>Oddly, the banh mi has always been the one kind of food I liked better outside its home turf. When I tried a banh mi in Ho Chi Minh City a few years earlier, I&rsquo;d found the bread stale and the ingredients skimpy; inside was a paltry mix of a few slices of ham, a smear of pate and flaccid cilantro and carrots. I gave up after one sandwich. I&rsquo;d had far better banh mi in New York City; even Minneapolis! Was I crazy? Could the banh mi outside of Vietnam actually be better? &nbsp;Now back in Vietnam, I was determined to find out the truth. Would my faith in the banh mi in its homeland be restored? Is the banh mi the best sandwich in the world?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<dl class="inline-image">\n<dt><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwtravel/464_261/images/live/p0/27/wq/p027wqdk.jpg" alt="Banh mi vendor, Vietnam, boat, sandwich" width="464" height="261" /></dt>\n<dd>A banh mi vendor on a boat in Vietnam. (Jupiter Images/Getty)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Banh Mi Pho Hue, Geoffrey Deetz &ndash; a chef and Vietnamese food expert who&rsquo;s been living in the country for nearly 15 years &ndash; was peppering the sandwich maker with questions about ingredients. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;d just been served my banh mi, partially covered with piece of white paper affixed with a rubber band.</p>\n<p>I pulled back a side of the baguette to get a look at the ingredients: pork deli meat, fatty char siu pork, pork floss, creamy pate, Chinese 5 spice and, curiously, butter.&nbsp; The sandwich maker finished it off by pouring pork-chili gravy inside. Interestingly, I saw none of the herbs and veggies that spill out of the baguettes served in southern Vietnam or outside of the country.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The banh mi sandwiches in Hanoi are much more one dimensional than other parts of the country,&rdquo; Deetz told me. &ldquo;If you gave someone here the kind of over-stuffed, herb-laden sandwich you&rsquo;ve eaten in other parts of the country, they&rsquo;d probably throw up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Happily, I didn&rsquo;t throw up. This banh mi was radically different, true. But it was just as good as the sandwiches I&rsquo;d eaten elsewhere. The crunch of bread was followed by an interplay of porky goodness with a slight kick of spice. &nbsp;It was more like a meat sandwich. I loved it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t really like overly complex food in Hanoi,&rdquo; Deetz added. &ldquo;But so many things in here have a function: the pork floss soaks up the sauce, the pate adds moisture and the fact that the baguette is lightly toasted keeps it from getting soggy in this immense humidity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<dl class="inline-image">\n<dt><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwtravel/464_261/images/live/p0/27/x3/p027x37y.jpg" alt="Hoi An, Vietnam" width="464" height="261" /></dt>\n<dd>A man rides a rickshaw in Hoi An, Vietnam. (Hoang Dinh Nam/Getty)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While in Vietnam, I also tried a banh mi in Hoi An, a Unesco World Heritage-designated city on the central coast. In a region known for fertile soil and vibrant herbs, it&rsquo;s no surprise the sandwiches there are stuffed with verdant vegetables.</p>\n<p>As I did in Hanoi, I asked everyone who would listen where I could find the best banh mi around. The answer was Banh Mi Phuong (‪Phan Chau Trinh 2B) a diminutive shop in the centre of town. I ordered the classic, which the menu board indicated contained &ldquo;bread, pork, ham, pate&rdquo;. But there was so much more: long slices of cucumber, fresh cilantro, pickled carrot and even juicy tomato slices. Phoung finished it off with a flurry of sauces: a squirt of chili sauce and two different pork sauces, one from boiled pork and one from smoked pork.</p>\n<p>The key to a good banh mi is, in fact, the bread. A bad baguette &ndash; a hard, crumbly log &ndash; will ruin an otherwise fine sandwich. Phuong&rsquo;s bread, baked right next door, was ultra-soft, almost deflating when I took a bite, while also maintaining a crispy exterior. Top that (literally) with high-quality pork, two different pork-based sauces and a few surprises like tomato and pickled papaya and I had a very good sandwich in my hands.</p>\n<p>All told, I sampled about 15 banh mi sandwiches over two weeks in Vietnam. Happily, I&rsquo;d eaten some of the best sandwiches I&rsquo;d ever had. That banh mi I tried in Saigon a few years ago &ndash; the one that turned me off to the sandwich for a while &ndash; was just a fluke.</p>\n<p>But is the banh mi the best sandwich in the world?</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s scene in The Simpsons in which Homer expresses bewilderment when his daughter, Lisa, becomes a vegetarian.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What about bacon?&rdquo; Homer asks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Lisa says.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ham?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pork chops?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Lisa says. &ldquo;Dad, those all come from the same animal!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah right,&rdquo; Homer says. &ldquo;A wonderful, magical, animal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Something that combines so much pork with fresh herbs all stuffed into a crispy baguette is, I have to say, a pretty magical sandwich.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwtravel/960_540/images/live/p0/27/wv/p027wvkh.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="380" /></p>', '0', 'abc, xyz', 0, 2, 1416070946, 0, 0, '1235369_730604670302532_1379585477_n.jpg', 0, 1, 0),

The UN has projected that the city’s population will rise to 4.5 million by 2025. Its residents own a total of more than 3.5 million motorcycles, which keeps traffic moving in such a densely populated area.\nHanoi\n\nThe best place to begin in Hanoi is with the city''s top tourist draw -- the Old Quarter.

Located between the Lake of the Restored Sword, the Long Bien Bridge, a former city rampart, and a citadel wall, the Old Quarter started as a snake and alligator-infested swamp. It later evolved into a cluster of villages made up of houses on stilts, and was unified by Chinese administrators who built ramparts around their headquarters. The area was named "Dominated Annam" or "Protected South" by the Chinese.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">The Old Quarter began to acquire its reputation as a crafts area when the Vietnamese attained independence in the 11th century and King Ly Thai To built his palace there. In the early 13th century, the collection of tiny workshop villages which clustered around the palace walls evolved into craft cooperatives, or guilds. Skilled craftsmen migrated to the Quarter, and artisan guilds were formed by craftsmen originating from the same village and performing similar services. Members of the guilds worked and lived together, creating a cooperative system for transporting merchandise to the designated streets in the business quarter.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Because inhabitants of each street came from the same village, streets developed a homogeneous look. Commoners'' homes evolved out of market stalls, before streets were formed. Because storekeepers were taxed according to the width of their storefront, storage and living space moved to the rear of the buildings. Consequently, the long and narrow buildings were called "tube houses." Typical measurements for such houses are 3 meters wide by 60 meters long.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">The Old Quarter has a rich religious heritage. When the craftsmen moved from outlying villages into the capital, they brought with them their religious practices. They transferred their temples, pagodas and communal houses to their new location. Each guild has one or two religious structures and honors its own patron saint or founder. Therefore, on each street in the Old Quarter there is at least one temple. Now, many of the old temples in the Old Quarter have been transformed into shops and living quarters, but some of the old buildings'' religious roots can still be recognized by the architecture of their roofs.</p>\n<p>Although the old section of Hanoi is often called the "36 Old Streets," there are more than 36 actual streets. Some researchers believe that the number 36 came from the 15th century when there might have been 36 guild locations, which were workshop areas, not streets. When streets were later developed, the guild names were applied to the streets. Others attribute the 36 to a more abstract concept. The number nine in Asia represents the concept of "plenty." Nine times the four directions makes 36, which simply means "many." There are now more than 70 streets in the area.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Some streets have achieved fame by their inclusion in popular guidebooks. Han Gai Street offers silk clothing ready-made and tailored, embroidery, and silver products. Hang Quat, the street that formerly sold silk and feather fans, now stuns the visitor by its brilliantly colored funeral and festival flags and religious objects and clothing. To Thinh Street connects the above two and is still the wood turner''s street. Hang Ma glimmers with shiny paper products, such as gift wrappings, wedding decorations and miniature paper objects to burn for the dead. Lan Ong Street is a sensual delight of textures and smells emanating from the sacks of herbal medicinal products: leaves, roots, barks, and powders.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Let us turn now to nine of the lesser known streets in the Old Quarter that possess a unique character worth exploring.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Hang Bac Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">A majority of the street names in the Old Quarter start with the word hang. Hang means merchandise or shop. The guild streets were named for their product, service or location. Hang Bac, one of the oldest streets in Vietnam, dates from at least the 13th century. Bac means silver, and appropriately, this street started as a silver ingot factory under the reign of Le Thanh Tong (1469-1497). Village people, called the "Trau Khe silver casters," were brought into the capital to cast silver bars and coins. After a ceremony to transfer their craft from their village of Trau Khe to Hanoi, they set up two temples to honor the founders of their craft. At one communal house, the silver was molten and poured into molds. At the other communal house, the molds were further processed for delivery to the Prime Minister. The crafters went to great lengths to keep their methods secret to avoid counterfeit products.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">At the turn of the 18th century, the street took on more varied functions. In addition to the casting of silver ingots, the street attracted more jewelry makers and money exchangers. Money exchangers thrived, since in the old days, paper money was not used. Instead, currency consisted of bronze and zinc coins and silver ingots. When merchants needed a large amount of money for business transactions, they would exchange the heavy metal bars on Hang Bac. During the French time it was called "Exchange Street." Although paper currency was later used, the word for it included the word bac.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Hang Bac also has jewelers of different types: engravers, smelters, polishers, and gold-leaf makers. The first jewelry makers were the Dong Cac guild, which settled during the Le dynasty (1428-1788). They founded a temple dedicated to three brothers who learned their art in China in the 6th century, and who are considered the patron saints of the Vietnamese jewelry making profession.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">There are several famous buildings on this street. In the communal house on Hang Bac, there is a stone stele, built in 1783, telling about a Mandarin who forcibly took over the communal house. The locals took him to court and won back their building. The Dung Tho Temple is dedicated to Chu Bi, a Taoist deity. At the end of the French colonial period, this temple had been named Truong Ca, after a person who watched over the temple and served the best noodle soup. One building on this street is the pride of contemporary history-the Chuong Vang (Golden Bell) Theater, which still hosts traditional Vietnamese theater performances. The former traditional-venue theater, the To Nhu (Quang Lac) Theater built in the 1920s, also is on this street but has been transformed into apartments.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Hang Be Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">In the mid-19th century, the guild of bamboo raft makers was located on this street outside the My Loc gate, one of the many sturdy gates to the city. The cai mang raft consisted of 12 to 15 large bamboo poles lashed together by strips of green bamboo bark. Their anterior was slightly raised by heating the wood, and the aft was rigged with three quadrangular sails made of coarse linen dyed with extracts of sweet potato skins.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Bamboo rafts were sensible for Hanoi''s shallow rivers, lakes and swamps, which can not provide solid anchorage or natural shelter from storms. The flat design better weathered the seasonal typhoons that lash the northern part of Vietnam, and is better adapted to coastal and river fishing. The bamboo poles from which the rafts were constructed were sold one block east on Hang Tre Street.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Cau Go Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">Meaning "Wooden Bridge," Cau Go Street is located one block north of the Lake of the Restored Sword, and was in fact the location of a wooden bridge. About 150 years ago, the bridge crossed a thin stream of water connecting the Thai Cuc Lake with the Lake of the Restored Sword. Dyers from the neighboring Silk Street set out their silk to dry or bleached their fabric beside the bridge. Under the French occupation, the lake and stream were filled as health measures and to increase buildable land. The little wooden bridge became a regular street.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">On the edge of the lake, women in wide brimmed hats once sold armfuls of flowers to the French for a few coins. Today a flower market exists where the Cau Go alley intersects with the main street. Other historical sites on Cau Go are the secret headquarters and hiding place of the 1930-45 "Love the Country" resistance movement.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Cau Go today is a commercial street specializing in women''s accessories.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Hang Dao Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">This street is one of Vietnam''s oldest streets. It serves as a main axis running from north to south, cutting the Old Quarter in half. In the French Colonial time, Hang Dao Street was a center for the trading of silk products. On the first and sixth days of the lunar month, there were fairs for the sale of silk items. Shops also sold other types of fabric such as gauze, brocade, crepe, and muslin. Almost all the non-silk products were white.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">In the beginning of the 15th century, this street was the location of the silk dyer guild from the Hai Hung Province, which specialized in a deep pink dye. Dao, the name of the street, refers to the pink of apricot blossoms, which are symbolic of the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. The demand for this special color was so high that the fabric had to be dyed at other locations as well.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">By the 18th century, the dye colors diversified. In the 18th-century work Notes About the Capital, the author wrote that "Hang Dao guild does dying work. It dyes red as the color of blood, black as Chinese ink, and other beautiful colors."</p>\n<p class="bodytext">In the 19th century, Hang Dao was lined by about 100 houses, of which only 10 or so were constructed of bricks. The rest were of thatch. On the side of the street alongside the now filled-in Hang Dao Lake, the foundations of the houses have visibly sunk lower than the road.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">By the turn of this century, Indian textile merchants opened shops for trading silk and wool products imported from the West. This street now specializes in ready-made clothing.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Dong Xuan Street / Market Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">This street originally belonged to two villages-the even numbered houses were occupied by the Nhiem Trung village, and the odd numbered houses were occupied by the Hau Tuc village.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">The Dong Xuan market, Vietnam''s oldest and largest market, occupies half of the street.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">River networks formed the economic hub of Hanoi by providing a system of waterways which fed the city and markets. Located at the confluence of the To Lich and Red Rivers, the Dong Xuan market was once one of the busiest urban areas in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">The French required merchants to bring their goods inside the fenced perimeter of the market in order to facilitate tax collections. When the number of merchants swelled, the market was enlarged. In 1889, a structure was built over it, and five gates were built leading to it. Each of the five market gates was used only for specified goods. In 1992, the market was renovated and a new facade erected.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Hang Mam Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">Hang Mam is the union of two old streets: an eastern offshoot called Hang Trung and the original Hang Mam. The name is derived from the various kinds of mam, or fish sauces, that are produced and sold here, as well as other sea products. The street was originally on the riverside, close to the day''s catch.</p>\n<p class="bodytext"><em>Nuoc mam</em>, or fish sauce, is made from fish that are too small to be sold individually which are placed in clay vats with water and salt. Boiled water is poured over the fish and weights are placed on top of the mixture to compress it. The concoction distills for days, and the result is a clear amber juice that is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. With aging, the fierce ammoniac odors of the fish become mellow, and like brandy, the flavor improves. The first pressing, which is the clearest and purest, is called nuoc mam nhi, or prime. The sauce was stored in barrels made on adjacent Hang Thung Street.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">In the 1940s, new specialties appeared on the street. A small ceramics industry appeared along with those of memorial stone etching, coffin, and tombstone manufacturers</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Ma May Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">This street also is a union of two old streets. Hang May sold rattan products, and Hang Ma sold sacred joss (paper replicas of money, clothing, even stereo sets) to burn for the dead. Ma is burned in front of the altar of ancestors accompanied by prayers. Around the turn of the century, the streets became one: Ma May.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">In the French time, this street was called "Black Flag Street" because the soldier Luu Vinh Phuc had his headquarters here. Luu was the leader of the Black Flags, a bandit unit operating around Hanoi in the late 19th century. They were essentially pirates who made a living robbing villagers and merchants. In the 1880s, the Black Flags cooperated with the Vietnamese Imperial Forces to resist the French who were attempting to gain military control of Hanoi.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">In the middle of the street is the Huong Tuong temple, established in 1450, which honors Nguyen Trung Ngan (1289-1370), a governor of Thang Long, the former name of Hanoi.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Hang Thiec Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">Hang Thiec is the street of tinsmiths. The craftsmen originally produced small tin cone-shaped tips which were used to preserve the shape of the traditional conical hats. A neighboring street, Hang Non, made the hats, and both streets comprised the Yen No hamlet.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Hang Thiec Street also produced oil lamps, candle sticks, and opium boxes. Tin shops sold mirrors, which they still do today, along with sheet metal, zinc, and glass. The street echoes busily with the clanging of hammers against the sheet metal. Workers spread out on the sidewalk shaping metal storage boxes and other objects to custom order.</p>\n<p class="subhead"><strong>Hang Thung Street</strong></p>\n<p class="bodytext">In the old days, on this block inside the Dong Yen gate, barrels were manufactured. The barrels were used for storing and carrying water and fish sauce. The communal house and the temple of the barrel makers'' guild is located at 22 Hang Thung, but is hidden behind newer buildings. The street is shaded by the leaves of the xoan tree which has a fluffy cream colored cluster flower and bright red berries. The tree has various English names: Margosa, Bead, or China Berry tree. In May, the tiny flowers fall to the ground like yellow confetti. The furrowed bark is often scraped off by local residents, who dry and boil it to make a medicinal infusion as a vermifuge.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">The Old Quarter is a precious legacy of Hanoi''s ancient past, but the area is challenged by rapid changes.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">Today, handicraft production is increasingly replaced by restaurants, repair shops, and mini hotels. Historic buildings have become mass living spaces and schools as the population increases. Craft workers now constitute nine percent of the neighborhood. Traders make up 40 percent.</p>\n<p class="bodytext">With the new economic policies, a dramatic building boom has begun, threatening the charm of the district. Local, national, and international agencies are now formulating plans to preserve the historic ambiance of the Old Quarter.</p>', '<p><img src="http://dantri.vcmedia.vn/Uploaded/2010/03/16/hoa101632010.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="276" /><img src="http://dantri.vcmedia.vn/Uploaded/2010/03/16/hoa41632010.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="275" /></p>\n<p><img src="http://dantri.vcmedia.vn/Uploaded/2010/03/16/hoa81632010.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="261" /><img src="http://dantri.vcmedia.vn/Uploaded/2010/03/16/ha91632010.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="285" /></p>\n<p><img src="http://c0.f21.img.vnecdn.net/2014/01/31/MG-0153-4431-1391141092.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="249" /><img src="http://m.f29.img.vnecdn.net/2013/09/09/17-1378708701.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><img src="http://loca.vn/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/file.321618.jpg" alt="" width="747" height="500" /></p>\n<p><img src="http://m.f29.img.vnexpress.net/2007/12/24/dsc7172-1348745683_480x0.jpg" alt="" width="747" height="523" /></p>', '', 2, 4, 1417876326, 0, 0, '10473785_374763386015745_8472622463761528726_o.jpg', 0, 1, 1),

(27, 'CUC PHUONG NATIONAL PARK', 'Established in 1962, Cuc Phuong is the oldest national park in Vietnam. Located only 120km southwest of Hanoi and nestled between the provinces of Ninh Binh, Hoa Binh and Thanh Hoa, Cuc Phuong boasts an engaging cultural and wildlife heritage and enchanting scenery. Magnificent Limestone Mountains rise up majestically from the green rice-terraces and traditional stilt houses of the Muong hill-tribe. Covered in a dense forest, this landscape forms the habitat for some of Asia''s rarest animal and plant species. It is no wonder that researchers, naturalists, enthusiasts and conservationists alike are drawn to this corner of the world. The ancient forest harbours over 2234 vascular and non-vascular plants, 122 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 135 mammals, including the Clouded Leopard, Delacour''s Langur, Owston''s Civet and Asian Black Bear. There are also an incredible 308 documented bird species. Visitors in April and May should be blessed with the chance to see literally thousands of vibrant butterflies. Located on 2 limestone mountain ranges, the landscape of Cuc Phuong contains a wonderfully rich ecosystem. The rocky outcrops of Cuc Phuong form the site of valuable pale ontological and anthropological vestiges, including a fossilized sea reptile dated at 200 - 230 million years old, while the remains of prehistoric people who lived in the forest some 7500 years ago are also to be found in the numerous mountain caves. In earlier times, Cuc Phuong was home to the Muong minority people and to this day a few scattered villages around the park''s periphery still house these interesting people and their unique culture. If you visit these communities you can still see their traditional stilt houses, waterwheels, bamboo rafts and brocade looms.  \n\nFrom Cuc Phuong we would suggest that you take a trip to Van Long, where you can see Delacour''s Langurs in the wild, to Tam Coc or to Ngoc Son and Pu Luong Nature Reserve - all within easy access. Just ask us and we will set you on the right path.', '<div class="article-rel-wrapper">\n<h2 class="contentheading">Cuc Phuong Tourism</h2>\n</div>\n<p><img src="http://www.cucphuongtourism.com/images/rokstories/03.jpg" alt="images" width="671" height="327" /></p>\n<p><strong>Trekking in the primary forest.</strong><br />Excellent hiking opportunities abound in the park and you could spend days trekking though the forest.

Popular trails will lead you to several ancient trees, caves and Muong villages. Park staff can provide you with basic maps to find the well-marked trailheads. However, a guided tour is the best and most informative way to get the most out of both short and long treks. Longer walks to Ngoc Son Nature Reserve and Pu Luong Nature Reserve, overnight treks and camping trips are also possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Community-Based Ecotourism &amp; Homestays.</strong></p>\n<p>The forests of Cuc Phuong are immensely important culturally, providing livelihood resources for local communities. However, the forests and its resources are under constant threat. Community-based ecotourism initiatives are beginning to turn marginalized communities into local stakeholders, creating incentives to support conservation. Why not take a trek to the Muong village of Khanh or to the villages in Ngoc Son Nature Reserve or Pu Luong Nature Reserve where the hospitable local people offer 1 or 2 night home-stay in their traditional stilt houses? While in the village you will live as one of the family, eat together, have an opportunity to explore their culture and try out bamboo river rafting!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><strong>Wildlife Night-spotting.</strong></span></p>\n<p>The park can organise night-spotting trips into the primary forest.

Notches are a feature of limestone cliffs worldwide, but those of Ha Long Bay are exceptionally well developed and, at many sites, extend into arches and caves. This process of undercutting and subsequent erosion maintains the steep faces of the fenglin karst towers and thereby perpetuates the spectacular nature of the landscape.</p>\n<p>A distinctive feature of Ha Long Bay is the abundance of lakes within the larger limestone islands.</p>\n<p>Extensive limestone caves represent another important feature of Ha Long Bay, with three main types able to be identified: old phreatic caves formed below the water table of the time; old karstic foot caves formed by lateral undercutting of cliffs at base level; and marine notch caves formed at sea level where rock structures are powerfully eroded and eventually reduced to a wave cut platform.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Ha Long Bay possesses a tremendous diversity of caves and other landforms which derive from the unusual geomorphological process of marine invaded tower karst.

It locates on the northern bank of Huong River, turning South with total land area of 520 ha. The place was made UNESCO Site in 1993 with the remained buildings being actively restored and preserved after the destruction from the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>The Imperial City of Hue has a circumference of 10 kilometers with the height of 6.6 meters and 21 meters thick with forts being meanderingly arranged, accompanied by cannons, artilleries and ammunitions. Initially the fortress was built solely by soil, only to be replaced by bricks afterward.

Once upon a time, local residents saw an old lady in red appear every night on top of the hill. She foretold that: one day, the Lord would pass by and build something of great importance. From then on, the hill was named Thien Mu Son (Mountain of Lady from Heaven). When Lord Nguyen Hoang actually went pass the hill, he heard the legend and decided to build a pagoda and named it Thien Mu. Having gone through a lot of eventful phase, damages as well as renovations, today the pagoda still exists and remains the unofficial symbol of the ancient city Hue.<img class="img-responsive w168h110" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.vietnamonline.com/upload/attraction/admin/2011/01/Thien%20Mu%20pagoda.jpg" alt="Thien Mu pagoda 0" width="488" height="366" /></p>\n<p><strong>What to see</strong></p>\n<p>As tourists approach the pagoda, what seizes their attention first is the seven-storey octagonal tower named Phuoc Duyen Tower (formerly Tu Nhan Tower).

A boat trip can also include visiting Hon Chen Temple and Minh Mang Tomb. A bike-trip is recommended, since the road is very scenic and rather short. Travellers can also combine a trip to Thien Mu Pagoda with Hue Temple of Literature and Huyen Khong Pagoda, which are just a few km away. One remind for those who are fond of bike: a perfect ride should be in early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat of Hue.</p>\n<p>The site opens daily from early in the morning till 5PM.

The karst landscape is an extremely complex and ancient one, with high geodiversity and some geomorphic features of considerable significance. It has an Earth crust development history from the Ordovician period (464 million years ago). This has produced three types of topography and geomorphology. One type is the non-karst landforms, which consist of low, round-top mountains with planation surfaces and abrasion-accumulation terraces along the valleys of the Son and Chay rivers and at the margins of the central limestone massif. The other major type is karst landforms, which are characterized by old tropical karst mainly from the Mezozoic era, but two-thirds of the site consists of karst from the Cenozoic. Extensive transitional landforms comprise an extremely complex intercalation of limestone massifs and terrigenous terrain with a diversity of rock types. The limestone occupies an area of about 200,000&nbsp;ha, with a similar adjacent area in the Lao People''s Democratic Republic and its highest point is 1,290&nbsp;m above sea level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GnPg2s5WWEc/VMhnasbsipI/AAAAAAAAF5o/LkwTAhpJLoQ/w860-h570-no/10487326_1437325313205340_6869059503840273050_n.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="444" /></p>\n<p>The karst formation process has resulted in many features such as underground rivers, dry caves, terraced caves, suspended caves, dendritic caves and intersecting caves. The active river caves are divided into the nine caves of the Phong Nha system discharging to the Son River, and the eight caves of the Vom system discharging to the Chay River. The Phong Nha Cave is the most famous in the entire system, with a currently surveyed length of 44.5&nbsp;km. Its entrance is the last part of an underground river that connects with the Son River and tour boats can penetrate inside to a distance of 1,500&nbsp;m. Other extensive caves include the Vom cave at 15&nbsp;km in length and the Hang Khe Rhy cave with a length of 18,902&nbsp;m.</p>\n<p>Some 92% of the park is covered by tropical forest, 92.2% of which is primary forest. By far the largest vegetation type is tropical dense moist evergreen forest on limestone. Although this was severely damaged by fire during the war, it is recovering rapidly and is now in a healthy state. It has a high level of faunal diversity and there are many vascular plants.</p>\n<p>A total of 568 vertebrate species have been recorded in the site, comprising 113 mammals, 81 reptiles and amphibians, 302 birds and 72 fish. The fauna is typical of the limestone karst forests of the Annamite mountains. The high mammal species richness includes threatened species such as tiger, Asiatic black bear, Asian elephant, giant muntjac, Asian wild dog, gaus, and the newly discovered sao la. The site is particularly rich in primates, with 10 species and subspecies forming 45% of the total number of species in Viet Nam.</p>\n<p>The Phong Nha-Ke Bang karst has evolved since the Palaeozoic era and so is the oldest major karst area in Asia.

There is also strong evidence that sulphurous solution and hydrothermal action have played an important role in shaping the broad-scale landscape and the caves. The incorporation of the Ke Bang forest into the park has added another very important dimension.</p>\n<p>This sector has many ''fossil'' caves at a high level, which occur when the groundwater and rivers move to a lower level. Only a very few have been visited to date. It is one of the most important eco-regions of the Indo-Pacific.

(36, 'VIETNAM HISTORY', 'VIETNAM HISTORY\n\nThe history of Vietnam begins around 2,700 years ago. Successive dynasties based in China ruled Vietnam directly for most of the period from 111 BC until 938 when Vietnam regained its independence. Vietnam remained a tributary state to its larger neighbor China for much of its history but repelled invasions by the Chinese as well as three invasions by the Mongols between 1255 and 1285. King Trần Nhân Tông later diplomatically submitted Vietnam to a tributary of the Yuan to avoid further conflicts. The independent period temporarily ended in the middle to late 19th century, when the country was colonized by France (see French Indochina). During World War II, Imperial Japan expelled the French to occupy Vietnam, though they retained French administrators during their occupation. After the war, France attempted to re-establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed. The Geneva Accords partitioned the country in two with a promise of democratic election to reunite the country.\n\nHowever, rather than peaceful reunification, partition led to the Vietnam War, a civil war and a major part of the Cold War. During this time, the People''s Republic of China and the Soviet Union supported the North while the United States supported the South. After millions of Vietnamese deaths and the American withdrawal from Vietnam in March 1973, the war ended with the fall of Saigon to the North in April 1975.

Successive dynasties based in China ruled Vietnam directly for most of the period from 111 BC until 938 when Vietnam regained its independence. Vietnam remained a tributary state to its larger neighbor China for much of its history but repelled invasions by the Chinese as well as three invasions by the Mongols between 1255 and 1285. King Trần Nh&acirc;n T&ocirc;ng later diplomatically submitted Vietnam to a tributary of the Yuan to avoid further conflicts. The independent period temporarily ended in the middle to late 19th century, when the country was colonized by France (see French Indochina). During World War II, Imperial Japan expelled the French to occupy Vietnam, though they retained French administrators during their occupation. After the war, France attempted to re-establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed. The Geneva Accords partitioned the country in two with a promise of democratic election to reunite the country.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">However, rather than peaceful reunification, partition led to the Vietnam War, a civil war and a major part of the Cold War. During this time, the People''s Republic of China and the Soviet Union supported the North while the United States supported the South. Copy at www.vietnambiketours.com, After millions of Vietnamese deaths and the American withdrawal from Vietnam in March 1973, the war ended with the fall of Saigon to the North in April 1975. The reunified Vietnam suffered further internal repression and was isolated internationally due to the continuing Cold War and the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. In 1986, the Communist Party of Vietnam changed its economic policy and began reforms of the private sector similar to those in China.

According to Vietnamese myths the first Vietnamese peoples descended from the Dragon Lord Lạc Long Qu&acirc;n and the Immortal Fairy &Acirc;u Cơ. Lạc Long Qu&acirc;n and &Acirc;u Cơ had 100 sons before they decided to part ways. 50 of the children went with their mother to the mountains, and the other 50 went with their father to the sea. The eldest son became the first in a line of earliest Vietnamese kings, collectively known as the H&ugrave;ng kings (H&ugrave;ng Vương or the Hồng B&agrave;ng Dynasty). The H&ugrave;ng kings called the country, which was then located on the Red River delta in present-day northern Vietnam, Văn Lang. The people of Văn Lang were referred to as the Lạc Việt.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Văn Lang was thought to be a matriarchal society, similar to many other matriarchal societies common in Southeast Asia and in the Pacific islands at the time. Various archaeological sites in northern Vietnam, such as Đ&ocirc;ng Sơn have yielded metal weapons and tools from this age. Most famous of these artifacts are the large bronze drums, probably made for ceremonial purposes, with sophisticated engravings on the surface, depicting life scenes with warriors, boats, houses, birds and animals in concentric circles around a radiating sun at the center.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Many legends from this period offer a glimpse into the life of the people. The Legend of the Rice Cakes (Sự T&iacute;ch B&aacute;nh D&agrave;y B&aacute;nh Chưng) is about a prince who won a culinary contest; he then wins the throne because his creations, the rice cakes, reflect his deep understanding of the land''s vital economy: rice farming. The Legend of Giong (Th&aacute;nh Gi&oacute;ng), copy at www.vietnambiketours.com, about a youth going to war to save the country, wearing an iron armor, riding an armored horse, and wielding an iron staff, showed that metalworking was sophisticated. The Legend of the Magic Crossbow (Sự T&iacute;ch Nỏ Thần), about a crossbow that can deliver thousands of arrows, showed extensive use of archery in warfare.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">By the 3rd century BC, another Viet group, the &Acirc;u Việt, emigrated from present-day southern China to the Red River delta and mixed with the indigenous Van Lang population. In 258 BC, a new kingdom, &Acirc;u Lạc, emerged as the union of the &Acirc;u Việt and the Lạc Việt, with Thục Ph&aacute;n proclaiming himself "King An Dương Vương". At his capital Cổ Loa, he built many concentric layers of walls around the city for defensive purpose. These walls, together with skilled &Acirc;u Lạc archers, kept the capital safe from invaders for a while. However, it also gave rise to the first story of espionage in Vietnamese history, which resulted in the downfall of king An Dương Vương.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">In 207 BC, an ambitious Chinese warlord named Triệu Đ&agrave; (Chinese: Zhao Tuo) defeated king An Dương Vương by having his son Trọng Thủy (Chinese: Zhong Shi) act as a spy after marrying An Dương Vương''s daughter. Triệu Đ&agrave; annexed the kingdom of &Acirc;u Lạc into his domain in present-day Guangdong, southern China, then proclaimed himself king of a new independent kingdom, Nam Việt (Chinese: 南越, Nan Yue). Trọng Thủy, the supposed crown prince, felt deeply remorseful and drowned himself in Cổ Loa because his wife was killed in the war.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Some Vietnamese consider Triệu''s rule a period of Chinese domination, since Triệu Đ&agrave; was a former Qin general. Others consider it an era of Việt independence as the Triệu family in Nam Việt were assimilated to local culture. They ruled independently of what then constituted China (Han Dynasty). At one point, Triệu Đ&agrave; even declared himself Emperor, equal to the Chinese Han Emperor in the north.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Period of Chinese domination (111 BC &ndash; 938 AD)<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">In 111 BC, Chinese troops invaded Nanyue and established new territories, dividing Vietnam into Giao Chỉ (Chinese: 交趾 pinyin: Jiaozhi, now the Red river delta); Cửu Ch&acirc;n from modern-day Thanh Hoa to Ha Tinh; and Nhật Nam, from modern-day Quang Binh to Hue. While the Chinese were governors and top officials, the original Vietnamese nobles (Lạc Hầu, Lạc Tướng) still managed some highlands.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">In 40 AD, a successful revolt against harsh rule by Han Governor T&ocirc; Định (蘇定 pinyin: Sū D&igrave;ng), led by the two noble women Trung Trac and her sister Trung Nhi, recaptured 65 states (include modern Guangxi), and Trung Trac became the Queen (Trưng Nữ Vương). In 42 AD, Emperor Guangwu of Han sent his famous general M&atilde; Viện (Chinese: Ma Yuan) to quell the revolt. After a torturous campaign, Ma Yuan defeated the Trung Queen, who committed suicide. Copy at www.vietnambiketours.com, To this day, the Trung Sisters are revered in Vietnam as the national symbol of Vietnamese women. Learning a lesson from the Trung revolt, the Han and other successful Chinese dynasties took measures to eliminate the power of the Vietnamese nobles. The Vietnamese elites would be coerced to assimilate into Chinese culture and politics. However, in 225 AD, another woman, Trieu Thi Trinh, popularly known as Lady Trieu (B&agrave; Triệu), led another revolt which lasted until 248 AD.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">During the Tang dynasty, Vietnam was called Annam (Giao Ch&acirc;u), until the early 10th century AD. Giao Chỉ (with its capital around modern Bac Ninh province) became a flourishing trading outpost receiving goods from the southern seas. "History of Later Han" (Hậu H&aacute;n Thư, Hou Hanshu) recorded that in 166 AD the first envoy from the Roman Empire to China arrived by this route, and merchants were soon to follow. The 3rd-century "Tales of Wei" (Ngụy Lục, Weilue) mentioned a "water route" (the Red River) from Jiaozhi into what is now southern Yunnan. From there, goods were taken overland to the rest of China via the regions of modern Kunming and Chengdu.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">At the same time, in present-day central Vietnam, there was a successful revolt of Cham nations.

All of them ultimately failed, yet most notable were L&yacute; B&ocirc;n and Triệu Quang Phục, whose Anterior L&yacute; Dynasty ruled for almost half a century (544 AD to 602 AD) before the Chinese Sui Dynasty reconquered their kingdom Vạn Xu&acirc;n.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Early independence (938 AD &ndash; 1009 AD)<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Early in the 10th century, as China became politically fragmented, successive lords from the Kh&uacute;c family, followed by Dương Đ&igrave;nh Nghệ, ruled Giao Ch&acirc;u autonomously under the Tang title of Tiết Độ Sứ (Virtuous Lord), but stopping short of proclaiming themselves kings.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify">&nbsp;</div>', '0', '', 2, 13, 1419862015, 0, 0, '1317722895_Vietnam_Travel_Map.jpg', 0, 1, 3);

(37, 'CULTURE OF VIETNAM', 'The Culture of Vietnam is one of the oldest of such in the Southeast Asia region. Although Vietnam lies geographically in Southeast Asia, long periods of interaction with its neighbors has resulted in the emergence of many East Asian characteristics in Vietnamese culture, and generally Vietnam is said to be part of the East Asian cultural sphere, known widely as Chinese cultural sphere. Historically, passing the imperial Mandarin exams was the only means for Vietnamese people to socially advance themselves.\nIn the socialist era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and the cultural influences of socialist programs. For many decades, foreign cultural influences were shunned and emphasis placed on appreciating and sharing the culture of communist nations such as the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and others. Since the 1990s, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to Southeast Asian, European and American culture and media.\nIn terms of prehistory, most Vietnamese historians consider the ancient Dong Son culture to be one of the defining aspects of early Vietnamese civilization.\n\nRural\nAbout 74% of Vietnamese currently live in rural areas, and although many are being influenced by the process of a growing economy, traditional rural customs and traditions still play a vital role in shaping the culture of Vietnam.Vietnamese really give consideration to protect and develop these traditions. Travelling to Vietnam means going on a trip to explore a different interesting culture.\n\nOrganization\nIn terms of societal levels of organization, the two most important units are làng (village) and nước (country). Vietnamese people usually say that "làng goes hand in hand with nước". Intermediate organizational units like the huyện (district) and tỉnh (province) are not as important. The culture is like a vast ocean of people.\n', '<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Kinship<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">In rural Vietnam, kinship plays an important role. If it can be said that Western cultures value individualism, then it can also be said that Eastern cultures value the roles of family and clan. Comparing with Eastern cultures, Chinese culture values family over clan while Vietnamese culture values clan over family. Each clan has a patriarch, clan altar, and death commemorations attended by the whole clan.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Most inhabitants are related by blood. That fact is still seen in village names such as Đặng X&aacute; (place for the Đặng clan), Ch&acirc;u X&aacute;, L&ecirc; X&aacute;, so on so forth. In the Western highlands the tradition of many families in a clan residing in a longhouse is still popular. In the majority of rural Vietnam today one can still see three or four generations living under one roof.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Because kinship has an important role in society, there is a complex hierarchy of relationships. In Vietnamese society, there are nine distinct generations. Virtually all commemorations and celebrations within a clan follow the principles of these nine generations. Younger persons might have a higher position in the family hierarchy than an older person and still must be respected as an elder.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">This complex system of relationships is conveyed particularly through the Vietnamese language, which has an extensive array of honorifics to signify the status of the speaker in regards to the person they are speaking to.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Marriage<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">In the past, both men and women were expected to be married at quite young ages (by today''s standards). Marriages were generally arranged by the parents and extended family, with the children having little to no say in the matter.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">In modern Vietnam, this has changed completely as people choose their own marriage-partners based on love, and in consideration primarily to their own needs and wants.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">The traditional Vietnamese wedding is one of the most important of traditional Vietnamese occasions. Regardless of westernization, many of the age-old customs practiced in a traditional Vietnamese wedding continue to be celebrated by both Vietnamese in Vietnam and overseas, often combining both western and eastern elements<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Religion and Philosophy<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Historically, the so-called Tam Gi&aacute;o ("triple religion"), characterizing the East Asian intricate mixture between Mahayana Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism has always had a large impact on Vietnamese society and philosophy. Of the three, Vietnamese Buddhism has always been the most popular with commoners.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Besides the "triple religion", Vietnamese life was also profoundly influenced by the practice of ancestor worship as well as native animism. Most Vietnamese people, regardless of religious denomination, practice ancestor worship and have an ancestor altar at their home or business, a testament to the emphasis Vietnamese culture places on filial duty.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Along with obligations to clan and family, education has always played a vital role in Vietnamese culture. In the old days, scholars were placed at the top of society. Men not born of noble blood could only wish to elevate their status by means of studying for a rigorous Imperial examination which could potentially open doors to a position in the government, granting them power and prestige as Mandarin officials<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Cuisine<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Vietnamese phở noodle soup with sliced rare beef and well done beef brisket.Vietnamese cuisine is extremely diverse, often divided into three main categories, each pertaining to Vietnam''s three main regions (north, central and south). It uses very little oil and many vegetables, and is mainly based on rice, soy sauce, and fish sauce. Its characteristic flavors are sweet (sugar), spicy (serrano peppers), sour (lime), nuoc mam (fish sauce), and flavored by a variety of mint and basil.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Vietnam also has a large variety of noodles and noodle soups. Different regions invented different types of noodles, varying in shapes, tastes, colours, etc. One of the nation''s most famous type of noodles is phở (pronounced "fuh"), a type of noodle soup originating in North Vietnam, which consists of rice noodles and beef soup (sometimes chicken soup) with several other ingredients such as bean sprouts and scallions (spring onions). It is often eaten for breakfast, but also makes a satisfying lunch or light dinner. The boiling stock, fragrant with spices and sauces, is poured over the noodles and vegetables, poaching the paper-thin slices of raw beef just before serving. Phở is meant to be savored, incorporating several different flavors: the sweet flavor of beef, sour lemons, salty fish sauce, and fresh vegetables.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Currently, Vietnamese cuisine has been gaining popularity and can be found widely in many other countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Laos, Japan, China, Malaysia, and France. Vietnamese cuisine is recognized for its strict, sometimes choosy selection of ingredients. A chef preparing authentic Vietnamese cuisine may incorporate the ingredients provided in these countries, but generally will prefer ingredients native to Vietnam.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aDCHxHVNTiXfx7mswksEyglDqnkhLjkqHf5hl0TcXD0=w500-h375-no" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Clothing<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Empress Nam Phuong in a formal court gown.In feudal Vietnam, clothing was one of the most important marks of social status and strict dress codes were enforced.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Commoners had a limited choice of similarly plain and simple clothes for every day use, as well as being limited in the colors they were allowed to use. For a period, commoners were not allowed to wear clothes with dyes other than black, brown or white (with the exception of special occasions such as festivals), but in actuality these rules could change often based upon the whims of the current ruler.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">The plain white &aacute;o d&agrave;i is worn as a uniform in Vietnamese high schools.The &Aacute;o tứ th&acirc;n or "4-part dress" is one such example of an ancient dress widely worn by commoner women, along with the &Aacute;o yếm bodice which accompanied it.

For footwear peasants would often go barefoot whereas sandals and shoes were reserved for the aristocracy and royalty.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">Monarchs had the exclusive right to wear the color gold, while nobles wore red or purple. Each member of the royal court had an assortment of different formal gowns they would wear at a particular ceremony, or for a particular occasion. The rules governing the fashion of the royal court could change dynasty by dynasty, thus Costumes of the Vietnamese court were quite diverse.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">The most popular and widely-recognized Vietnamese national costume is the &Aacute;o D&agrave;i, which is worn nowadays mostly by women, although men do wear &Aacute;o d&agrave;i on special occasions such as weddings and funerals. &Aacute;o d&agrave;i is similar to the Chinese Qipao, consisting of a long gown with a slit on both sides, worn over silk pants. It is elegant in style and comfortable to wear, and likely derived in the 18th century or in the royal court of Huế. White &Aacute;o d&agrave;i is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across Vietnam. Some female office workers (e.g. receptionists, secretaries, tour guides) are also required to wear &Aacute;o d&agrave;i. &Aacute;o D&agrave;i was once worn by both genders but today it is worn mainly by females, except for certain important traditional culture-related occasions where some men do wear it.<br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify"><span class="size9 PalatinoLinotype9" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''Palatino Linotype'', serif;">In daily life, the traditional Vietnamese styles are now replaced by Western styles.

(41, 'Sapa - Fansipan', 'Surrounding Sapa are the Hoang Lien Mountains, dubbed the Tonkinese Alps by the French. These mountains include the often cloud-obscured Fansipan (3143m), Vietnam’s highest peak. Fansipan is accessible year round to sensibly equipped travellers in good shape, but don’t underestimate the challenge. It is very wet, and can be perilously slippery and generally cold. Don’t attempt an ascent if Sapa’s weather is poor, as limited visibility on Fansipan can be treacherous.\n\nThe summit of Fansipan is 19km from Sapa and can be reached only on foot. The terrain is rough and adverse weather is frequent. The round trip usually takes three days; some experienced hikers do it in two days, but you’ll need to be fit. After walking through hill-tribe villages on the first morning, it’s just forest, mountain vistas and occasional wildlife, including monkeys, mountain goats and birds.\n\nNo ropes or technical climbing skills are needed, just endurance. There are a few rudimentary shelters at a couple of base camps en route, but it’s better to be self sufficient with sleeping bag, waterproof tent, food, stove, raincoat or poncho, compass and other miscellaneous survival gear. It’s vital to carry out all your garbage, as some of the camps are now impacted by trash. Hiring a reputable guide is vital, and porters are also recommended.\n\n\n\n', '<p><strong>Day 1</strong>&nbsp;Hanoi &ndash; Lao Cai<br />8.00 pm: Transfer from your hotel to Hanoi Railway Station to catch the night train (soft sleeper with air conditioning) to Lao Cai.</p>\n<p>Meals: N/A | Accommodation: cabin on train</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2</strong>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Lao Cai &ndash; Sapa &ndash; Fansipan</strong></span><br />Arrivel at Lao Cai railway station early in the morning</p>\n<p>On arrival, you will &nbsp;meet your tour guide then&nbsp;transferred by shuttle Van to Sapa.

The ramification of the Red River into smaller rivers flowing through Thang Long provided convenient water ways for people from all surrounding provinces and even faraway lands to access the markets in the city centers. Bat Trang, the village famous for excellent pottery wares, is located on the northeast bank of the Red River and thus soon became a port for pottery trading activities. Besides the large and permanent markets, Thang Long also hosted numerous small and mobile markets which were easily formed by just a few vendors presenting their goods along the sidewalks or anywhere that people walked through.</p>\n<div id="attachment_120" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cho-buoi-xua.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-120" title="cho buoi xua" src="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cho-buoi-xua.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></a>\n<p class="wp-caption-text">Buoi market in late 1800s</p>\n</div>\n<p>Generally, the marketplace was consisted of various stalls/booths, each offering a different commodity or a specific type of goods. Booths selling relevant items were located near each other, forming sections specifying in commodities of particular field. Food, clothes, and household facilities were the three main sections often included in a sizable market.</p>\n<p>Malls selling a mixture of different goods were not observed until the French colonization period. This is understandable given the limited number of workers in each family, the most common unit of business in Vietnam in those days. Focusing on a specific item allowed family members not only to produce more in a faster pace, but also to improve techniques through intensive exposure to, and thorough experience of, working procedures. The elders passed down their life-accumulating experience to the young members as family secrets, giving the new generation the advantages of having first-hand knowledge and being trained under supervision of experts.</p>\n<p>If manufacturing was a heavy task requiring the cooperation of lots of people, guilds and groups of workers were formed and separate tasks were assigned to people of appropriate capacities. This labor specialization in the earliest forms helped improve the quality of the goods produced and also gave rise to the famous network of 36 streets in the ancient quarter of Hanoi. The 36-street section in the center of Thang Long could be considered a giant market with each street focusing on the production and sale of its professional products. Streets, thus, were named after the products they sold. For example, &ldquo;Hang Mam&rdquo;, meaning the street of fish sauce, had most of its families supplying a wide variety of fish sauces for customers.</p>\n<p><a href="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cho-buoi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-121" title="cho buoi" src="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cho-buoi.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></a></p>\n<dl id="attachment_121" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<dd class="wp-caption-dd">A typical market in the North in 1980s</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Generations by generations, the primary markets improved gradually in terms of commodity diversity, trade volume and value.

Since shoppers are local residents, people exchange their greeting and take advantage of a few minutes waiting for their stuffs to be wrapped to chit chat. The morning market sessions in Vietnam always possess unique mix of sounds that can hardly be found anywhere. The bargaining between buyers and sellers, the sellers&rsquo; call for their fellows to ask about selling rate, the sounds of livestock kept in crowded cages. Many women, including my grandmother and mother, consider walking around the market to shop in early morning as an hour jogging.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the wet market is not a wonderful daily event without annoyances. The most outstanding concern is the health issue as the sanitary conditions at all mobile markets and most permanent markets are bad. Only some big markets have their own sewage systems, which are often inadequate and not taken care of duly. Sanitization to most sellers only stops at cleaning and washing by water. In many meat stalls, owners present chunks of raw meat on unclean tables without any means of protection and thus meat is often exposed to all kind of dusk, viruses, and insects like flies. Water used to wash and process food is directed to run into the next-by creek or common sewage pipeline, sweeping with it all the remains and dirty disposals. Air, soil, and water in the proximity of the marketplaces are thus polluted. Unsanitary conditions also stem from the fact that trash is not collected timely and sufficiently. Stall owners only make sure their areas are free of trash but care not about other common places. Some food booths are situated next to the pile of discarded things or stinking water way.</p>\n<p><a href="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/onhiem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-136" title="onhiem" src="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/onhiem.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></a></p>\n<p>Unsanitary condition at marketplaces is a woe</p>\n<p>Another problem is the undetermined source of food. Owners are mostly small traders who buy their products from small farms, gardens, or slaughter house scattered in the city suburb. These individual businesses in turn provide their homemade products without bills or records. Thus, no bills or receipts are given or kept for any transactions and taxes thus largely go uncollected. Again, the uncertified source of products, together with the unsanitary conditions of the marketplaces, presents great obstacles for authorities and medical officials to trace back the source of diseases if any malice springs and causes widespread health problems.</p>\n<div id="attachment_137" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012073012cho-noi-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-137" title="2012073012cho-noi-1" src="https://khaithu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012073012cho-noi-1.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></a>\n<p class="wp-caption-text">Floating market &ndash; a particular feature of provinces in MeKong Delta area &ndash; each boat is a floating store and moving along the river.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Wet markets have sustained strongly along with all historical changes of Vietnam and establish themselves as an important part of Vietnamese culture. Although incurring undeniably bad points, wet market do offer merits that Vietnamese people cannot ignore and thus, still assert itself as the main grocery distribution channel. Going to the wet market to get fresh food for meals within that day is the practice that Vietnamese people have kept for thousands of years. As tradition deepens, wet markets become part of Vietnamese culture. They are so unique to Vietnam, the country and the people.</p>\n</div>', '0', '', 2, -1, 1422542849, 0, 0, 'market.jpg', 0, 1, 3);
